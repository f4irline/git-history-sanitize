description: Implement a Linear ticket following the full workflow
agent: pitmaster
---

Parse the input: `$ARGUMENTS`
- The first word is the **ticket ID** (e.g., `STU-15`)
- Everything after is **additional context** from the user (optional, e.g., "this needs extensive research", "focus on performance", "skip tests for now")

You are implementing the ticket. If additional context was provided, adjust your approach accordingly.

> **CRITICAL: Context Compaction Safety**
> The progress document contains a **Workflow Checklist** that tracks completion of all phases.
> After ANY interruption or context compaction, ALWAYS read the progress document first and
> continue from where the checklist indicates. The workflow is NOT complete until all phases
> (Implementation → Learnings → Push & PR) are checked off.

Follow these steps:

## Before Cooking

**Mandatory House Rules Gate:**
- Before doing repository work, capture the launching checkout with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` as `workflow_root` and initially set `worktree_path` to the same value.
- Use the Read tool directly on `{workflow_root}/.opencode/HOUSE_RULES.md`.
- Do not use Glob, Grep, or directory listing to locate or test this known path.
- Treat the loaded rules as binding for the entire workflow; do not require or load a copy from the ticket worktree.
- If the direct read fails, stop with `BBQ_PHASE_RESULT: FAILED` and report the read error.
- Track any required exception explicitly in progress documentation.

1. Move the ticket to "In Progress" status using Linear MCP
2. Read the full ticket details from Linear, including research and planning comments
3. **Check the pantry for learnings**: If `docs/learnings/` exists, scan all files for learnings relevant to this ticket's domain. Keep these in mind during implementation.

4. Ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear before starting
5. Use the `git-branch-create` skill to resolve a properly named ticket branch
6. Unless the user or active workflow explicitly requires working in the root checkout, use the `git-worktree-prepare` skill to create or reuse a dedicated worktree for that branch
   - Worktree behavior is **default-on** for `/bbq.fire`
   - Worktrees are created under `.opencode/.bbq-worktrees/` in the project root
   - Local-only files are mirrored from `.opencode/worktree-local-files`
   - Capture outputs as `workflow_root`, `branch_name`, and `worktree_path`
   - If working without a dedicated worktree, keep `worktree_path` equal to `workflow_root` and use worktree state `root`

7. From this point forward, run **all git, code, test, and documentation actions in that worktree path**
   - Prefer explicit path-aware commands (`git -C "{worktree_path}" ...`) when possible
   - Do not rely on the process current directory; this applies whether `worktree_path` is the root checkout or a dedicated worktree
8. Use the `git-push-remote` skill with explicit inputs `worktree_path` and `branch_name`

## Fire the Grill (Phase 1: Implementation)

9. Begin implementation:
   a. Use the progress-doc skill in `worktree_path` to create the progress document (includes Workflow Checklist)
   b. Write or modify unit tests first (TDD approach)
   c. If there are API changes, write integration tests
   d. Implement the changes according to the plan and House Rules
   e. Update progress documentation as you go, including House Rules compliance notes and worktree context
   f. Use the git-commit skill from `worktree_path` to commit changes as you go and finish the tasks from progress document
10. After implementation is complete, the validate-changes plugin will automatically run lint, build, and tests
11. Use the git-commit skill from `worktree_path` to commit changes with proper message format
12. Run the Implementation Review Gate below before updating the Workflow Checklist. Mark "Phase 1: Implementation" items as complete only after it passes.

Ensure all tests pass before proceeding.

## Write Down What You Learned (Phase 2: Learnings)

13. **Extract learnings** from this implementation session — but only if something technically relevant was learned:
    - A surprising API behavior or gotcha worth remembering
    - A workaround for a bug or limitation
    - A pattern that should be followed in the future
    - An architectural decision with non-obvious rationale
    
    Skip this step if the work was routine and nothing noteworthy emerged.
    
14. For each learning worth documenting:
    - Categorize it (gotcha, pattern, decision, or discovery)
    - Create `docs/learnings/` directory if it doesn't exist
    - Append the learning to the appropriate file with ticket ID and date using the `learnings` skill
    - **Commit any new learnings** using the git-commit skill from `worktree_path`
    
15. Summarize what was documented:
    ```
    Documented X learnings:
    - gotchas.md: "Title"
    - patterns.md: "Title"
    ```
    
    If nothing noteworthy was learned, say so briefly and move on.

16. **Update the Workflow Checklist**: Mark "Phase 2: Learnings" items as complete in the progress doc

## Push and Create PR (Phase 3: Finalize - FINAL STEP)

**IMPORTANT: Only proceed with this section AFTER all implementation, testing, documentation, and learnings are complete. Do NOT push or create a PR until everything else is finished.**

17. **Finalize progress documentation**: Update the progress document with:
    - Status changed to "Complete"
    - Final progress log entry summarizing what was accomplished
    - All task checkboxes updated
    - Complete list of files changed
    - House Rules compliance status and approved exceptions (if any)
    - Worktree path used for implementation
    - **Commit this update** using the git-commit skill from `worktree_path` before proceeding
18. Use the git-push-remote skill with explicit `worktree_path` and `branch_name` to push all commits to remote
19. Create a pull request using GitHub MCP with:
    - Clear title referencing the ticket
    - Description summarizing changes
    - House Rules compliance summary (or approved exception notes)
    - Worktree context note (path or "resolved worktree layout")
    - Link to the Linear ticket
20. Move the ticket to "In Review" status using Linear MCP
21. **Update the Workflow Checklist**: Mark "Phase 3: Finalize & Push" items as complete

> **REMINDER**: The workflow is complete ONLY when all three phases in the Workflow Checklist are fully checked off.

## Implementation Review Gate

After implementation and validation are complete, use the Task tool to spawn the `health-inspector` subagent from `worktree_path`. Give it the ticket ID, user context, `workflow_root`, `worktree_path`, and this task: review the completed implementation and its diff against the full Linear ticket, Technical Plan, House Rules, relevant learnings, and validation results.

- If it returns `REVIEW_RESULT: PASS`, continue with the Learnings phase.
- If it returns `REVIEW_RESULT: CHANGES_REQUIRED`, resolve every blocking and important finding in `worktree_path`, update tests and progress documentation as needed, run the relevant validation again, commit the revisions with the git-commit skill, then spawn a fresh `health-inspector` review.
- Run at most 3 review-and-revision rounds total. If the work still does not pass after round 3, do not continue to Learnings, push, create a PR, or move the ticket to "In Review". Stop and ask the user for further instructions, including the unresolved findings.

## Terminal Result

Include exactly one result line in every response:

```text
BBQ_PHASE_RESULT: COMPLETE
```

When a user decision or clarification is needed, use the `question` tool and wait for its answer in the current session. Do not emit `BBQ_PHASE_RESULT: BLOCKED` before calling the `question` tool. Return `BBQ_PHASE_RESULT: BLOCKED` only if the phase still cannot continue after the user interaction. Return `BBQ_PHASE_RESULT: FAILED` if the phase cannot complete because of an execution error. Emit `COMPLETE` only after all three workflow checklist phases are complete, the branch is pushed, the pull request exists, and the ticket is moved to "In Review".
