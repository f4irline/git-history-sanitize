description: Show current status of a Linear ticket across Linear and GitHub
---

Parse the input: `$ARGUMENTS`
- The first word is the **ticket ID** (e.g., `STU-15`)
- Everything after is **additional context** from the user (optional)

Show the current status of the ticket across all systems. If additional context was provided, keep it in mind.

Before gathering status, check if `.opencode/HOUSE_RULES.md` exists:
- If it exists, read it first and treat it as governing guidance for this workflow.
- Use it to flag any obvious compliance risks or required exceptions visible from ticket, branch, or PR context.
- If it does not exist, continue normally.

Gather and display:

1. From Linear MCP:
   - Ticket title and description
   - Current status
   - Assignee
   - Priority
   - Recent comments/updates
2. From Git:
   - Use git-find-ticket-branch skill to find related branch(es)
   - Show branch status (ahead/behind main)
   - Recent commits on the branch
3. From GitHub MCP:
   - Find any PRs related to this ticket
   - PR status (open, merged, closed)
   - Review status (approved, changes requested, pending)
   - Open comments count
4. If House Rules are present:
   - Include a brief compliance snapshot
   - Call out any item that appears to need an exception or governance review

Present a clear summary of where this ticket stands in the workflow, including House Rules signals when available.
